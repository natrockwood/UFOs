# UFOs

This project was built to help Dana create an informative and interactive website that will provide users with easy access to information about possible UFO sightings in different areas, and at different points in time.

Being able to filter all the data Dana had with the use of JavaScript and HTML, makes it easier for users to pinpoint what they want to read about and helps provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

One thing that would help this website would be to include dropdown filters. Since we have a lot of data included in the table, it would help to see right away which dates are involved and which locations are available to read about. We don't want to have outdated data!
